## AWS Technical Blogs - Vietnamese Translation Collection

As part of my internship at AWS First Cloud Journey, I translated several technical AWS blog posts from English to Vietnamese to help the Vietnamese-speaking community access valuable AWS knowledge and best practices. This initiative contributes to making cloud computing resources more accessible to local developers and cloud practitioners.

Each translation maintains the technical accuracy of the original content while adapting the language to be natural and understandable for Vietnamese readers. The blogs cover diverse AWS topics including storage optimization, compute services, and emerging technologies like Physical AI.

### Translated Blogs:

###  [Blog 1 - How to size an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system](3.1-Blog1/)
This comprehensive guide helps you determine the appropriate sizing for Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems. It covers key concepts like storage efficiency, data deduplication, compression ratios, and capacity planning strategies. The blog provides practical formulas and real-world examples for calculating required storage capacity when migrating from on-premises NetApp ONTAP systems to AWS, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness.

###  [Blog 2 - Introducing default instance categories for AWS Batch](3.2-Blog2/)
AWS Batch introduces simplified instance selection with default_x86_64 and default_arm64 categories. This blog explains how these new default categories automatically choose optimal EC2 instance types for your batch workloads, eliminating the need to manually specify instance families. Learn about the benefits of automatic instance selection, cost optimization opportunities, and how to leverage both x86 and ARM-based instances for different workload requirements.

###  [Blog 3 - Preventing machine breakdowns: How Physical AI predicts equipment problems](3.3-Blog3/)
Explore the cutting-edge application of Physical AI in predictive maintenance for industrial equipment. This blog demonstrates how AWS IoT FleetWise collects real-time vehicle and machinery data, while Amazon SageMaker builds machine learning models to predict potential failures before they occur. Discover how companies can reduce downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and transform from reactive to proactive maintenance strategies using AWS AI/ML services and IoT technologies.
