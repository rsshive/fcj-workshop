During my internship at **AWS - First Cloud Journey** from **September 9, 2025** to **December 9, 2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world cloud computing environment.  
I participated in **comprehensive AWS cloud services training and hands-on workshops**, focusing on core AWS services including EC2, S3, VPC, Lambda, and various networking and security solutions. Through this experience, I improved my skills in **cloud architecture design, infrastructure automation, networking configuration, security best practices, technical documentation, and problem-solving in cloud environments**.  

Throughout the program, I engaged in multiple practical labs and real-world scenarios, translating technical AWS blogs, participating in AWS community events, and developing a complete workshop demonstrating S3 access patterns through VPC Gateway Endpoints and Interface Endpoints. This hands-on approach significantly enhanced my understanding of cloud technologies and AWS best practices.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, maintained consistent progress through weekly worklogs, and actively engaged with the AWS community and fellow participants to improve my learning efficiency and contribute knowledge back to others.

To objectively reflect on my internship period, I would like to evaluate myself based on the following criteria:
