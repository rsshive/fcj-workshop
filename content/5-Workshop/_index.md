# AWS Cognito + Amplify SDK Workshop

## Overview

**Amazon Cognito** is a fully managed user authentication, authorization, and user management service that makes it easy to add sign-up, sign-in, and access control to web and mobile apps.

In this hands-on workshop, you will:

- Create and configure a **Cognito User Pool** from scratch
- Integrate the latest **AWS Amplify Gen 2 (v6+)** with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**
- Implement a complete authentication flow:  
  Sign-up → Email verification → Sign-in → Protected routes → Role-based access
- Follow production-ready best practices (SSR support, secure token handling, clean architecture)

**Final outcome:** A fully functional, secure Next.js application with user authentication — ready to deploy on Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify Hosting.
